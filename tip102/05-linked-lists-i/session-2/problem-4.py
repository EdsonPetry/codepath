Problem 4: Does it Cycle?
A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced earlier in the course 
is to have a slow and a fast pointer that increment at different rates. Given 
the head of a linked list, use the slow-fast pointer technique to write a function 
has_cycle() that returns True if the list has a cycle in it and False otherwise. A 
linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points
 back to a previous node in the list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and 
provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space 
complexity.
