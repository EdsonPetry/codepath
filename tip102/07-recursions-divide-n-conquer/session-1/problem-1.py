Problem 1: Counting Iron Man's Suits
Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, has designed many different suits over the years. Given a list
of strings suits where each string is a suit in Stark's collection, count the total number
 of suits in the list.

Implement the solution iteratively without the use of the len() function.
Implement the solution recursively.
Discuss: what are the similarities between the two solutions? What are the differences?

Example Output:
3
4
