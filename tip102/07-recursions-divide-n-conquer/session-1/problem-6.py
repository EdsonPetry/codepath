Problem 6: Strongest Avenger
The Avengers need to determine who is the strongest. Given a list of their
strengths, find the maximum strength using a recursive approach without using
the max() function.

Evaluate the time complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide
a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity.

Example Output:

100
Example 1 Explanation: The maximum strength among the Avengers is 100.

90
Example 2 Explanation: The maximum strength among the Avengers is 90.
