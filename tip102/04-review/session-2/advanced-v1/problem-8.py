Problem 8: Analyze Storyline Continuity
Maintaining a coherent and continuous storyline is crucial for immersion. A storyline may consist of several scenes, each associated with a timestamp that indicates when the event occurs in the narrative. Write a function that, given a list of scene records with timestamps, determines if there are any gaps in the storyline continuity by checking if each scene follows in chronological order.

Iterate through the scenes and verify that the timestamps of consecutive scenes are in increasing order. If any scene is found to be out of sequence, your function should return False, indicating a gap in continuity; otherwise, it should return True.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
