Problem 6: Manage Character Arcs
Character arcs are crucial to maintaining a coherent narrative. These arcs often involve a series 
of events or changes that must occur in a specific order. As the story progresses, you may need to 
add, remove, or update these events to ensure the character's development follows the intended sequence.

Your task is to simulate managing character arcs using a stack. Given a series of events representing 
a character's development, use a stack to process these events. Add events to the stack as they occur and 
pop them off when they are completed or no longer relevant, ensuring that the character arc maintains the 
correct sequence.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.
